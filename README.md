## About Aera

### Welcome to Aera
Aera is a thoughtfully designed productivity application that helps you build your area of focus. It brings tasks, habits, notes, calendar planning, and focus sessions into one calm and intentional space—so you can work with clarity, not pressure.

### What Aera Helps You Do
- Manage tasks with priorities, due dates, and subtasks  
- Create smart notes with rich formatting and organized folders  
- Track habits with streaks and long-term progress  
- Run focus sessions and timers with optional ambient sounds  
- Plan calendar events and reminders  
- View insights and activity summaries to reflect and improve  

### Our Philosophy
We believe productivity should feel personal, quiet, and empowering.  
Aera is built with a privacy-first mindset, meaning your data stays with you—always under your control.

Aera is not about doing more.  
It’s about creating the right area of focus for what matters.

**Version:** Aera v1.0.4
